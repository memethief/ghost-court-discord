case: 1
summary: >
  This is a haunting rights dispute between two ghost claimants of the
  property at 1151 Sumner Street.
plaintiff: 
  name: Wope-Kisux
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You are a Lenape ghost and have been haunting the land that is now 
    1151 Sumner Street since your death in 1782. To haunt the place of 
    your death is your right, and you intend to do so forever. Other 
    ghosts have always respected this, but now a new ghost named 
    Partlow refuses to acknowledge your claim.
defendant:
  name: Partlow
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You have been haunting the property you owned in life at 1151 
    Sumner Street since your death last year. You owned the property, 
    and now your children do, and youâ€™ve chosen to stay and haunt it. 
    Unfortunately another ghost thinks they have rights to haunt it 
    instead.

case: 2
summary: >
  This is a behavior complaint by the living plaintiff against the resident
  poltergeist at 61 Bellwood Court.
plaintiff: 
  name: Byrne
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    Your property at 61 Bellwood Court is a lovely home for you and your
    family, but there is one annoying catch -- it came with a poltergeist
    that doesn't respect boundaries. All you want is some peace and
    quiet, but apparently that's simply impossible.
defendant:
  name: Gurlewicz
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You are a poltergeist -- the restless dead! Making an unholy racket is
    kind of your thing. The Plaintiff in this case knew damn well that the
    house at 61 Bellwood Court was going to be rocking at the time of
    purchase, and you have a right to self expression.

case: 3
summary: >
  This is a tenancy case between the ghost plaintiff who has been evicted
  and the living property owner at 919 Sherman Street.
plaintiff: 
  name: Turnbull
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You are a quiet, peaceful ghost being forced out of your beloved
    attic at 919 Sherman Street by new occupants through devious legal
    chicanery, even though you were promised a safe haunting place in
    perpetuity by the wise, kind and understanding original owners.
defendant:
  name: Wong
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    Turnbull, the ghost that lives in the attic of your new home at 919
    Sherman Street, has been legally evicted but refuses to leave. In
    fact, they've brought you to Ghost Court in a feeble attempt to assert
    their "right" to stay, based on some unwritten agreement with the
    previous owner.

case: 4
summary: >
  This is a behavior complaint by the living plaintiff against the family
  ghost at 4001 Mason Court Drive.
plaintiff: 
  name: Fernandez
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    Your Beardsley Avenue bed-and-breakfast is a nice retirement
    business, and having the ghost of your spooky ancestor around is a
    wonderful perk -- at Halloween. The rest of the year, you'd prefer a more
    sedate and guest-friendly haunting, but your dead relative won't leave
    well enough alone. Constantly scaring the guests!
defendant:
  name: Fernandez
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    Being a fantasma is great, especially in a house full of your relatives.
    You keep an eye on them! And you love scaring people, so the
    constant stream of visitors is great. Now they've brought you to Ghost
    Court to force you to settle down, but as their elder you find this both
    disrespectful and insulting.
---
case: 5
summary: >
  This is a contract dispute between the living owner of Ye Olde Haunted
  Well, Inc. and an employee ghost.
plaintiff: 
  name: Jenkins
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You run Ye Olde Haunted Well, a haunted well/gift shop/miniature
    golf park. The well's ghost, Lucrecio, is wonderfully Gothic and a real
    draw -- when they are around. Lately they have taken to slacking off, and
    that has been disastrous for your business. You need them haunting
    their frickin' well! Lucrecio signed a contract.
defendant:
  name: Lucrecio
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    Until recently you haunted the well you were thrown down many years
    ago, which seemed natural. People came to pity your sad tale. But then
    you started thinking, and gradually your religious convictions overtook
    you. Now haunting seems sinful and wrong, and you are resolved to haunt
    no more, contract or not.
---
case: 6
summary: >
  This is a tenancy dispute related to infidelity and child custody between
  the ghost plaintiff and the living defendant. It's sort of a rat's nest of
  complications.
plaintiff: 
  name: Boyd
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You shouldn't have gotten into a relationship with the living -- the
    defendant's spouse -- but you did, and the two of you had flve half-ghost
    children together. And then, the usual -- betrayal; your "love" ran
    off and now all you want is a place for your broken family to live, a
    basement of your own, perhaps in your old lover's house.
defendant:
  name: Fisher
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    Your spouse had a long-term affair with the Plaintiff, who is a ghost,
    and together they had five half-ghost children. Then your spouse
    abandoned both of you, and now the ghosts want to move into the
    basement of your house. You don't owe these people anything, much
    less room in your home.
---
case: 7
summary: >
  This is a haunting rights case between two ghosts who want to
  haunt the same person.
plaintiff: 
  name: Mangiani
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    Chris Phipps, 8002 North Adolph Avenue, is a terrible person worthy
    of the best haunting, and that is exactly what you provide. You've
    made Phipps' life a living hell, but now another ghost wants to
    horn in on the action, and that is unacceptable.
defendant:
  name: O'Dell
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    Chris Phipps, 8002 North Adolph Avenue, is a terrible person worthy
    of the best haunting, and that is exactly what you provide. You've
    made Phipps' life a living hell, but now another ghost wants to chase
    you off, and that is unacceptable.

case: 8
summary: >
  This is a contract dispute between the living manager of the Coffer
  Avenue Theater and a ghost employee.
plaintiff: 
  name: Price
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    The Defendant, the ghost Lafarga, made a verbal promise to haunt
    the Coffer Avenue Theater in exchange for various perks including
    unlimited free screenings. Lafarga has instead stayed away from the
    historic landmark and left it ghostless, in breach of contract. You want
    Lafarga on the job, or you want damages.
defendant:
  name: Lafarga
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You made a verbal promise to haunt the Coffer Avenue Theater
    in exchange for free screenings. However, recently the noted ghost
    hunter Pauline Couchenour has been attending screenings, randomly
    but quite often. You dare not cross paths with Couchenour, who could
    capture or disperse you.
---
case: 9
summary: >
  This is a contract dispute hinging on the ghost defendant's ability
  to communicate with a deceased relative of the living plaintiff.
plaintiff: 
  name: Kadow
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    The Defendant, the ghost Rames, agreed to act as an intermediary
    between you and your deceased mother. Certain concessions were
    made, including permission to haunt your hot dog cart on East
    Market Street. The Defendant never contacted your mother, instead
    fabricating excuses, and refuses to stop haunting your cart.
defendant:
  name: Rames
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You agreed to act as an intermediary between Plaintiff Kadow and the
    Plaintiff's dead mother, in exchange for haunting rights to Plaintiff's hot
    dog cart. You did make contact, but Kadow's mother is in hell and
    cannot communicate sensibly. You fulfilled your end of the bargain but
    Kadow refuses to believe it.
---
case: 10
summary: >
  This is a personal injury claim between a living plaintiff and a
  ghostly defendant.
plaintiff: 
  name: Prohl
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    Coming out of the Sea Breeze Dry Cleaners on Straw Street,
    you were ambushed by a terrifying ghost (the Defendant). Excessively
    terrified and shocked, you slipped on a discarded slice of pizza and
    fell, injuring your neck and hip. You want damages for medical expenses.
defendant:
  name: Foxwell
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You haunt the sidewalk in front of Sea Breeze Dry Cleaners on Straw
    Street, and you are damn good at it. You radiate menace and terror,
    almost as if you were a ... ghost. Which you are. The fool taking you
    to Ghost Court was startled and fell down, and somehow that's your
    fault, because you did your job too well?
---
case: 11
summary: >
  This is a property dispute between the ghostly plaintiff and living
  defendant revolving around ownership of a recently discovered
  necklace.
plaintiff: 
  name: Connell
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    The Defendant discovered a long-hidden emerald necklace that was
    the instigating factor in your death, a very nice piece that originally
    belonged to you before being concealed by your murderer so many
    years ago. You want it back and the Defendant, Wicker, flatly refuses to
    return it.
defendant:
  name: Wicker
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You found a lovely emerald necklace stashed under the floor of your
    kitchen during some remodeling. There's no way to know who it
    belonged to originally, but it belongs to you now. You may keep it, or you
    may sell it, but there's no way you are giving it to a ghost.
---
case: 12
summary: >
  This is a contract dispute between living people about the defendant's
  certification of the status of a property at 96 Hudson Street.
plaintiff: 
  name: Clatterbuck
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You received assurances that the hardware store you bought from the
    Defendant at 96 Hudson Street -- Fenstermacher's hardware -- was
    100% ghost-free. That was patently false, since the establishment is
    prominently haunted by the ghost of an angry little girl named Amanda
    Cecil. It is a clear case of breach of warranty.
defendant:
  name: Fenstermacher
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You sold your hardware store at 96 Hudson Street -- Fenstermacher's
    hardware, since renamed Clatterbuck Hardware -- to Plaintiff
    Clatterbuck for a fair price. At the time it was, as far as you know,
    ghost-free. After Clatterbuck moved in a ghost showed up, but that can't
    possibly be your fault.
---
case: 13
summary: >
  This is a financial dispute concerning a loan made by the ghost plaintiff to
  the living defendant.
plaintiff: 
  name: Nanney
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You made a deal with the Defendant to loan a cache of old gold coins so
    that the property they owned -- and you diligently haunted -- on Corke
    Street could be improved. You were never compensated or paid back for
    your loan.
defendant:
  name: Melendez
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    The ghost that haunts your Corice Street property showed you where a
    cache of gold coins was buried. You used the windfall to build a nice
    deck. Now the ghost is claiming that it was a "loan", and wants to
    be compensated for the coins. All they did was point at a spot in the
    yard and wait for you to dig up the coin jar.
---
case: 14
summary: >
  This is a property dispute between living people concerning care and
  upkeep of a ghost dog.
plaintiff: 
  name: Sterthanus
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    Early in your marriage you agreed to adopt a rescue ghost dog -- a
    Hauntweiler -- and it brought you closer. But over time the relationship
    soured, and you are getting divorced. Now your former spouse refuses
    to take any responsibility for the demanding pet you shared, and
    you are tired of cleaning up the ectoplasm.
defendant:
  name: Sterthanus
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    Early in your marriage you very reluctantly agreed to adopt a rescue
    ghost dog -- a Hauntweiler -- at your spouse's insistence. But over time
    the relationship soured, and you are getting divorced. Now your
    former spouse insists that you take the demanding pet you shared, even
    though it was never your idea.

case: 15
summary: >
  This is a property dispute between the living plaintiff and a ghost
  defendant concerning haunting-related damage to an automobile.
plaintiff: 
  name: Hersi
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You were driving over the Russell Avenue Bridge wlhen a specter in
    white distracted you, resulting in minor but noticeable damage to
    your BMW 7-series. You want the Defendant, who is clearly
    responsible, to compensate you.
defendant:
  name: Tamlin
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    Somebody had an accident and wants you to pay for damages. Your
    haunting of Russell Avenue is well known and announced with signs
    along the road. You have as much of a right to float wistfully above the
    creek as anyone!
---
case: 16
summary: >
  This is an employment dispute brought by the ghost plaintiff
  against their living employer about the division of labor within the
  company.
plaintiff: 
  name: Durston
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You are no longer getting the best haunting shifts from manager
    Bracca because of a new hire who died in a much cooler way. Your
    employment contract doesn't specifically say shifts will be fairly
    distributed, but ghosts live off of scares, so not getting the busy shifts
    is effectively a firing!
defendant:
  name: Bracca
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You staff the best ghosts, and give the best and most numerous
    shifts to the ghosts who draw the best crowds. It's just business. The
    employment contract the Plaintiff, a ghost named Durston, signed
    doesn't specifically say shifts will be fairly distributed. Durston does not
    draw a crowd.
---
case: 17
summary: >
  This is a dispute over haunting rights brought by the living
  plaintiff against the ghost defendant revolving around the appropriate
  location for haunting within a domicile.
plaintiff: 
  name: Sweeney
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You like the Defendant and enjoy their skilled haunting. When you
    decided to put in a rooftop garden, you asked them to relocate to a lower
    floor, since their death energy kills all plant life. They refused, citing a
    "Certificate of Haunting", which isn't. even a thing. If they would
    just move down one floor you'd be overjoyed.
defendant:
  name: Howard
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You've haunted the second floor patio of 600 Yeager Way for 100
    years. It's where you belong, and you have a Certificate of Haunting
    from 1929 to prove it. When the current occupant decided to turn it
    into a rooftop garden, well, the fact that your death energy killed all the
    plants was a logical consequence.
---
case: 18
summary: >
  This is a dispute over defamation related to the defendant's death
  under the medical care of the living plaintiff.
plaintiff: 
  name: Tulipano
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    It is true that the Defendant died on your operating table, but you didn't
    "kill" them, as they loudly proclaim. The fact is they were so badly injured
    it is a miracle they even made it to the hospital. Now they are defaming
    you in this world and the next, and it needs to stop. Your reputation is
    being ruined!
defendant:
  name: Jefferson
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    Dr. Tulipano's hand was on your heart when it stopped beating,
    and that's the simple fact in this case. You tell people Tulipano is
    responsible for your death, and the doctor wants to shut you up. Could
    another surgeon have saved you? Hard to say, but Tulipano sure didn't,
    and you'll tell whoever will listen.
---
case: 19
summary: >
  This is a haunting rights dispute related to access to a site of death,
  brought by the plaintiff, a ghost representing a minor, against the
  living defendant.
plaintiff: 
  name: Patel
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You are in Court representing a minor, a child named Walter Jackson
    who was run over by a garbage truck, who wants access to the location of
    his death. The yard where he expired on South Main Street has been
    blocked off with decorative cold iron fencing that no ghost can pass
    through. It needs to come down.
defendant:
  name: Mladenka
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You don't know about ghosts but you do know about security, and
    South Main Street is a rough area, and you've got kids. So you put up a
    heavy iron fence that cost a fortune, and now some ghost comes along
    with a sob story about needing access to your front lawn to haunt
    the place and scare your babies. No way!
---
case: 20
summary: >
  This is a haunting rights dispute between the ghost plaintiff
  and living defendant related to obstruction of ghostly smells from
  a retail business.
plaintiff: 
  name: Shribman
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You consider yourself an excellent haunter, and generate a ferocious
    brimstone smell. Unfortunately, Wagtail's Barbecue Restaurant next
    door produces so much pit smoke that your most prominent feature is
    disguised by meat odors. They need to put in a heavy duty air scrubber.
defendant:
  name: Travis
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    Your business, Wagtail's Barbecue on Jewell Drive, draws foot traffic
    with the delicious odor of slow-cooked pork shoulder from your
    hickory-fired pit. A local ghost claims that your restaurant is
    covering up a brimstone odor and impacting effective haunting. They
    want you to install very expensive air handlers.
---
case: 21
summary: >
  This is a haunting rights dispute between the ghost plaintiff and living
  defendant concerning admission to age-controlled establishments.
plaintiff: 
  name: Spiller
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You died when you were 20 years old, which at the time was old enough to
    own your own business, home and horse. Recently you were repeatedly
    and unlawfully denied entry into the Defendant's business, Razzle's Show
    Club at East 137th Street, despite having roamed the Earth for over
    140 years.
defendant:
  name: Asante
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You own and operate Razzle's Showclub, an adult entertainment
    business featuring naked people and over-priced alcohol. You are not
    prejudiced against ghosts -- you are prejudiced against twenty year olds,
    because you'll lose your license if anyone under 21 steps through your
    door.
---
case: 22
summary: >
  This is a haunting rights case brought by the living plaintiff
  against the ghost defendant related to the haunting of an object rather
  than a location.
plaintiff: 
  name: Alterdice
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You own a late model Lexus you got gently used. The paperwork didn't
    mention that it was haunted, but it was actually pretty cool having a
    ghost on board -- at least until you started making ends meet by driving
    for a ride-sharing service. Now your customers are freaked out and the
    ghost has got to go.
defendant:
  name: Morris
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    Most ghosts haunt a place but you haunt an object -- the Lexus sedan
    you died in. As with all ghosts, late night haunting is integral to your
    identity and happiness, and you can't just pick another location. You tried
    to be nice about it but after initially being welcoming, the Plaintiff has
    become very hostile.
---
case: 23
summary: >
  This is an employment dispute between two ghosts related to the
  tenor of a graveyard haunting.
plaintiff: 
  name: Bugg
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    Haunting the graveyard at 1100 Continental Avenue is a dream job,
    and there's room enough for two ghosts, and you and Shovelton were
    a great team for a while. But lately Shovelton has been getting slack,
    playing it for laughs rather than the terror from beyond the grave,
    and the graveyard has become a laughing stock.
defendant:
  name: Shovelton
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You co-haunt a graveyard and it's wonderful -- lots of visitors, built-in
    spookiness, and a good friend to haunt with. But lately Bugg has
    been taking it way too seriously. People visiting a grave are already
    sad. The least you can do is lighten their spirits a little, pardon the pun.
---
case: 24
summary: >
  This is a contract dispute between a ghost and a college campus Greek
  house.
plaintiff: 
  name: Goggins
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You signed a contract to haunt the Greek house at 414 Bentwood
    Avenue, specifying that the residents and their guests would abide by all
    applicable campus regulations. The campus has an ordinance from 1899,
    when you were a student there, that was never repealed, stipulating quiet
    hours after 10 PM. Alpha Beta Delta is never quiet.
defendant:
  name: Alpha Beta Delta
  status: Alive
  group: Yes
  summary: >
    You hired a ghost to haunt your awesome Greek house to add
    ambiance to your many epic parties. Right away the ghost started
    complaining about noise, and not "call the police" levels of noise,
    either. It's unreasonable to expect a group of college students to tip-toe
    around like church mice after 10PM.
---
case: 25
summary: >
  This is a haunting rights dispute between living plaintiffs and a ghost
  defendant related to the limits of acceptable poltergeist disturbance
  in a public space.
plaintiff: 
  name: Friends of the Library
  status: Alive
  group: Yes
  summary: >
    A poltergeist has no place in a library, and Parkhill Memorial
    Library's circulation has plummeted since the Defendant arrived in all
    their smelly, destructive glory. You aren't anti-ghost, but there's a time
    and a place for' everything.
defendant:
  name: Jolley
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You were murdered in a stable where Parkhill Memorial Library now
    stands, and you're still upset about it -- not least because Josiah Parkhill,
    philanthropist and librarian, is the guy who killed you! Who can blame
    you for raising a stink -- literally?
---
case: 26
summary: >
  This is a contract dispute between a living plaintiff and a recently
  deceased defendant over payment and ownership of a guitar.
plaintiff: 
  name: Muggeridge
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You agreed to sell your '68 Gibson hollow body electric guitar to the
    Defendant, who put down half the price. They died a few days later, and
    now they want their money back. A deal's a deal and you want them to
    pay the rest and take the guitar off your hands.
defendant:
  name: Sinclair
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You agreed to buy the Plaintiff's '68 Gibson hollow body electric
    guitar, and put down half the asking price. Then you died, and obviously
    a ghost can't play a guitar, so you want your money back. Or rather,
    you want your next of kin to receive the money. You're still getting used
    to being a ghost.
---
case: 27
summary: >
  This is a contract dispute between living litigants related to appropriate
  disclosure of the nature of a value-added haunting.
plaintiff: 
  name: Krabel
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    When you moved into your rental house at 4833 Swift Avenue you were
    promised a haunted premises. What you got was a haunted couch, and
    when that couch became ... soiled ... you were forced to throw it out.
    You compensated the landlord for the price of the couch, but you
    still expect a proper haunting as stipulated in your rental contract.
defendant:
  name: Naggs
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You own a rental property at 4833 Swift Avenue. You rented it as "plus
    ghost". The current tenant managed to destroy the piece of furniture (a nice
    mid-century modern couch) that the ghost was haunting and threw it out,
    along with the poor ghost. Now they want another ghost? People are awful.

case: 28
summary: >
  This is a haunting dispute between a formerly-married pair of ghosts and
  their residence at 5 Chipp Street.
plaintiff: 
  name: Levinson
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You and your spouse both died in a sad accident in your old bungalow
    at 5 Chipp Street. At first you cohaunted happily, but over time you
    grew apart. Now you can't stand each other, and need to haunt the place
    alone. You bought the bungalow with your own money back in 1919.
    It still technically belongs to you. You can never share!
defendant:
  name: Levinson
  status: Dead
  summary: >
    You and your spouse both died in a sad accident in your creepy old
    bungalow at 5 Chipp Street. At first you co-haunted happily, but over
    time you grew apart. Now you can't stand each other, and need to haunt
    the place alone. You are the better haunter by far, and a new family is
    moving in soon to fix the place up. You can never share!

case: 29
summary: >
  This is a financial contract dispute between living litigants related to the
  disbursement of money in a shared account.
plaintiff: 
  name: Washington
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You are the divorced ex-spouse of the Defendant. During the divorce
    money was put in escrow to handle litigation costs, which they used
    to buy expensive equipment for "having a physical relationship"
    with their ghost lover. You want that money paid back.
defendant:
  name: Logothetis
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You are the divorced ex-spouse of the Plaintiff. During the divorce
    money was put in escrow to handle litigation costs, and you used some
    of it to purchase equipment for contacting spirits in hell to provide
    character references. One of these was an ex-lover, and your partner is
    very upset about that.

case: 30
summary: >
  This is a financial and inhuman rights dispute between the undead
  plaintiff and living defendant related to an application for employment.
plaintiff: 
  name: Karimov
  status: Undead
  summary: >
    You are a blood-sucking creature of the night, a vampire! When the
    Old Times Museum posted an advertisement for "non-living guides
    born in the 1860s" for an upcoming exhibit, you applied -- and were
    unceremoniously turned away. You want your application fee back, plus
    damages.
defendant:
  name: Truong
  status: Alive
  summary: >
    You are the Human Resources Manager for the Old Times
    Museum, a living history museum dedicated to preserving ways of
    life that are fading into memory. For your upcoming "Pioneers of
    the land" exhibit, you sought out harmless ghosts who had actually
    been pioneers. When a vampire applied you turned them away.
